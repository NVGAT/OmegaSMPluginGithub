# OmegaSMPluginGithub
The official server plugin for the Omega SMP.

# What does it do?
The Omega SMP plugin helps differenciate the Omega SMP from any other by giving the players five lives that they lose if they die to another player. When they lose all of their lives they will be banned from the server and drop an unnaturally enchanted item and a resurrection shard which can be used to make the Revival item. In turn, the revival item is used to revive dead players and bring them back to 5 lives.
